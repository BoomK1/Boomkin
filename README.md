How Does everything work:


The Rotation is designed to detect and execute actions based on single target or multiple scenarios automatically. So you can just chill and let the rotation do its magic.

When it comes to Trinkets and Cooldowns, the rotation is equipped with 80+ different trinket usage to assure the max amount of damage. For example it support all Double on use trinkets, Empyreal+(Stat use trinket) this will lead to insane Convoke, the rotation will use Empyreal > 2nd trinket> CA > Convoke > Racial. This means the moment that we start Channeling convoke we are benefiting from both trinkets.

Legendaries:
Currently it supports Pulsar and  Balance of all Things So it will execute accordingly and prioritise actions accordingly. 

Mythic+Affixes:
The rotation has a built in system to detect Quaking and calculate the possibilities to finish the cast or cancel current cast.

Mouseover:
The mouseover system implemented has it all, to activate these features requires you have /xxxxx MOMF toggle ON. I recommend you have it active all the time as all @mousever actions are coded behind this brain commend.
So @mouseover will execute different actions automatically based on information collected on mouseover a friendly or enemy target.
1-Rebirth if friendly target is Dead
2- Remove Corruption if friendly target is affected by a curse or poison
3- Soothe enemy targets in mythic+ 
4-Will cast Entangling Roots on specific enemies in mythic + such as Slimy Smorgasbord in plaguefall, Illusionary Vulpin & Spinemaw Reaver in Mists.
5- Hibernate at enemy NPC in raid Shades of Borghast
6-Moonfire Spread in mythic+, will check if dot exist or not and if requires refresh with respect to target health remaining.
7-Moonfire on Explosive affix.

Auto-Dot Bosses:
The rotation will automatically dot bosses in dungeons and raids, this never means that you will break crowd control on any mechanic, there is a blacklist for all NPC’s  and Bosses to avoid such unfortunate action. Though you can still target that specific enemy ID and you will damage it. And all this happens without selecting or losing your main target.

Auto-Dot Dungeons:
Here there is beside the mouseover Moonfire spread another system that automatically dot Moonfire, this option is designed to increase our damage output in dungeons when we are in Solar Eclipse and fighting multiple targets.

Utility Usage of spells:
Boomkin is currently in the mythic+ Dungeons meta and not only due to the phenomenal damage we bring but also the extra utility we are packed with.
We are well equipped with many spells vital for any comp and Affix, Therefore some spells are not included in a rotation but kept on a command to fire the moment are required such as:
Force of Nature, Solar Beam, Ursol’s Vortex, Typhoon. These have macro commands to be controlled with smooth and effectiveness. 

Healing and Defensive:
The rotation has a well built defensive/healing system and can use different abilities to avoid death but you are still required to move out of fire.
Support for the use of Healing potion, Healthstone, Barkskin, and Renewal.

Shapeshifting:
Here we have full support to all shapeshift forms while in combat, as long as you are moving you will stay in that form.
